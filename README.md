# RayTracing

CS3241 Lab4 and more

This is a raytracing implementation done as part of CS3241 Lab4. The code takes a scene and outputs the corresponsing image rendered with raytracing.
A .obj reader has been added so that more complex objects and shapes may be rendered in the scene. Below are the different images with a different reflection/recursive level.

Below is the final output picture with the obj reader used to read a couple of objects such as a teddy and a teapot.
